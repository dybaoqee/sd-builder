# sd-builder

Opinionated builder for react web projects.

## Usage

* `sd-builder dev` sets up dev environment with auto-recompiling
* `sd-builder build` builds the project
* `sd-builder lint` lints files with eslint
* `sd-builder test` runs tests
* `sd-builder coverage` runs tests and calculates coverage

## Main conventions

### Html

* The builder expects there to be an `app/main.html` file, which is compiled
  into `build/index.html`. For now the compilation consists in a simple a
  copy/paste.

### JS

* The builder expects there to be an `app/main.jsx`Â file, which is used as
  `webpack`'s entry point. The generated bundle is written to
  `build/_assets/js/app.js`.

* Files are compiled by babel. It's up to the user to specify which plugins to
  use by installing and listing them in a `.babelrc` config file.

* npm modules listed in `deps.json`'s `js` array are separated from the main
  bundle and compiled into `build/_assets/js/vendor.js`.

* During `webpack`'s compilation `NODE_PATH` includes the `app` directory.

* It's possible to `require` / `import` `.js`, `.jsx` and `.json` files.

* Source maps are always generated.

### Assets

* The content of the folder `app/assets` will be recursively copied into
  `build/_assets`.

### CSS

* Files listed in `deps.json`'s `css` array are bundled (concat) into
  `build/_assets/css/vendor.css`.

### Fonts

* Files listed in `deps.json`'s `fonts` array are copied (concat) into
  `build/_assets/fonts`.

### Tests

* Test files go into the `test` directory. They can either have a `.js` or a
  `.jsx ` extension.

### General

* When `NODE_ENV=production` JS and CSS files are minified.

* When `NODE_ENV=development`, a `build/app-config.js` is generated, containing
  one global variable, `APP_CONFIG` which is a map of all variables specified in
  `.env`.

* Linting can be configured with a `.eslintrc` file.
